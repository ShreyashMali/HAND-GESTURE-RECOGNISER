# Gesture Recognizer – Sign Language to Letter Detection

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **hand gesture recognition system** that detects and identifies English letters (A–Z) based on **sign language hand signs**.
The dataset was created by **capturing our own hand sign images**, and the model was trained using **machine learning/deep learning techniques** to recognize each letter.

## 🚀 Features

* Detects hand gestures and maps them to corresponding letters.
* Custom dataset created from real captured hand signs.
* Trained model for high-accuracy classification.
* Works in real-time using a webcam.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* OpenCV – Image capturing & preprocessing
* TensorFlow/Keras / PyTorch – Model training
* NumPy & Pandas – Data handling
* Matplotlib – Visualization

## 📂 Dataset

* Created manually by capturing multiple images for each letter (A–Z).
* Each gesture was performed by multiple individuals for variation.
* Images were preprocessed (resized, normalized) before training.

## 📊 Model

* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
* Trained for X epochs with accuracy of Y% (replace X and Y with your results).
* Supports real-time prediction via camera input.


## 📌 Future Improvements

* Expand to full ASL/ISL vocabulary recognition.
* Improve model accuracy with more diverse datasets.
* Add multi-letter/word prediction.
